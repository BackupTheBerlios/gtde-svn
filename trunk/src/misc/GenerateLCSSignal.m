function y = GenerateLCSSignal(x,sinusCoefficients,sinusPhases,sinusFrequencies)

%Generate a Linear Combination of Sinusoids (LCS) discrete signal.
%
% USAGE: Signal = GenerateLCSSignal(Times,sinusCoefficients,sinusPhases,sinusFrequencies)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Times ~ time instants at which we want to sample the continuous signal.
%   sinusCoefficients ~ coefficients of the linear combination.
%   sinusPhases ~ phase of each of the terms.
%   sinusFrequencies ~ oscillation frequencies of each term.
%
% RETURN VALUE:
%   Signal ~ discrete signal resulting from the sampling.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   Signal = GenerateLCSSignal(t,[0.2,1],[0,pi/2],[10,20])
%   This will generate a discrete signal which is the sum of two sinusoids
%   sampled at t. The first sinusoid is shifted by 0 radians, at frequency 
%   10 Hz and weitghed by 0.2. The second sinusoid is shifted by pi/2, at
%   frequency 20 Hz and weitghed by 1.
