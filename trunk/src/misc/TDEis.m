function [index sign] = TDEis(mic1,mic2,NMics)

%Index and sign of a TDE given the two microphones' indices
%
% USAGE: [index sign] = TDEis(mic1,mic2,NMics)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   mic1, mic2 ~ indices of the first and second microphones
%   NMics ~ number of microphones
%
% RETURN VALUE:
%   index, sign ~ self-explanatory
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Computes the index of the tde that corresponds to mic1 and mic2 on a
%   vectorized representation.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   In case we have five microphones. The vectorized representation of the
%   tde's is:
%       t = (t12 t13 t14 t15 t23 t24 t25 t34 t35 t45)
%   In that case: 
%       [index,sign] = TDEis(2,3,5) gives index = 5 and sign = 1.
%       [index,sign] = TDEis(4,3,5) gives index = 8 and sign = -1.
%       [index,sign] = TDEis(6,1,5) gives an error.
