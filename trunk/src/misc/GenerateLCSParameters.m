function [sinusCoefficients sinusPhases sinusFrequencies] = ...
    GenerateLCSParameters(samplingPeriod,numberOfFrequencies)

%Generate the parameters of a Linear Combination of Sinusoids (LCS).
%
% USAGE: [sinusCoefficients sinusPhases sinusFrequencies] = GenerateLCSParameters(samplingPeriod,Length)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   samplingPeriod ~ the sampling period is used not to generate
%     frequencies larger than the Nyquist frequency.
%   Length ~ Desired length of the signal.
%
% RETURN VALUE:
%   sinusCoefficients, sinusPhases, sinusFrequencies ~ Parameters generated
%     for a LCS.
