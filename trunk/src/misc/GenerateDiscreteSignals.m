function [signals times] = GenerateDiscreteSignals(Position,MICS,samplingPeriod,Length,signal,C)

%Generates discrete signals from their analytic expressions
%
% USAGES: 
%   [signals times] = GenerateDiscreteSignals(Position,MICS,samplingPeriod,Length,signalChoice[,C])
%   [signals times] = GenerateDiscreteSignals(samplingPeriod,Length,signalChoice[,C])
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Position ~ position of the sound source
%   MICS ~ microphones' position
%   samplingPeriod ~ desired sampling period
%   Length ~ length of the signals
%   signal ~ signal function handle
%   C ~ sound speed
%
% RETURN VALUE:
%   signals ~ generated discrete signals
%   times ~ sampling times
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
%   The first syntax will generate as many signals as rows in MICS with 
%   the perceived signals from Position. The sampling period, the length 
%   and the signal should be specified. Sound speed is optional.
%
%   The second syntax will generate the "emitted" signal.
