function [cc ccd ccdd] = CCInterpolation(PCCC,Delay,SamplingPeriod,ZeroIndex)

%ccInterpolation Cross-correlation function interpolation
%
% USAGE: [cc ccd ccdd] = CCInterpolation(PCCC,Delay,T[,ZI])
%
% PARAMETERS:
%  PCCC ~ cross-correlation signals of the polynomial coefficients.
%  Delay ~ delay is the point(s) in which we want to estimate the signals'
%     cross-correlation function.
%  T ~ the signals' sampling period.
%  ZI ~ the index on the PCCC representing no delay (the default value is ceil(L/2), where L is the
%     size of the coefficients cross-correlation function.)
% 
% RETURN VALUE:
%  cc,ccd,ccdd ~ The value of the cross-correlation function, its first and
%     its second derivative.
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
%     This function estimates the value of the cross-correlation function
%     at Delay from from the polynomial coefficients' cross-correlation 
%     signals PCCC.
