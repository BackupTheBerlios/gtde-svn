function [CrossCorrelation Derivative Curvature] = InterpolateCrossCorrelation(FirstSignal,SecondSignal,Delays,SamplingPeriod,MaxDelay)

%InterpolatieCrossCorrelation interpolates the cross-correlation function 
%of two discrete signals
%
% USAGE: [CrossCorrelation Derivative Curvature] = 
%   InterpolateCrossCorrelation(FirstSignal,SecondSignal,Delays,SamplingPeriod)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   FirstSignal ~ values of the first signal
%   SecondSignal ~ values of the second signal
%   Delays ~ delays in which we want to evaluate the cross-correlation function
%   SamplingPeriod ~ sampling period of the signals
%
% RETURN VALUE:
%   CrossCorrelation ~ values of the cross-correlation function at delays
%   Derivatives ~ values of its derivative at delays
%   Curvature ~ values of its second derivative at delays
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function interpolates the cross-correlation function at times Delays
%   of the signals FirstSignal and SecondSignal (sampled at SamplingPeriod). 
%   It does that assuming some polynomial interpolation at each time interval.
% 
%   This function will then compute:
%   1) The sequence of coefficients of each polynomial interpolation.
%   2) The cross-correlation of these sequences of coefficients.
%   3) The interpolation of the cross-correlation function at each of the Delays.
