function [solverOutput, methodOptions] = ngTDE_DIP(PCCC, microphones, samplingPeriod, x0, methodOptions)

%Unconstrained time difference estimation
%
% USAGE: [TDE fVal cVal] = ngTDE_parallel(sigPCCC, microphones, samplingPeriod, x0)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%     PCCC ~ polynomial cross correlation of the signals' coefficients
%     microphones ~ positions of the microphones
%     samplingPeriod ~ sampling period of the signal
%     x0 ~ initialization points of the local minimizer
%     methodOptions
%
% RESULT:
%     The time delay estimates.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     Estimates the time difference of signals (or their Polynomial 
%     Coefficients Cross-Correlation) acquired by microphones 
%     sampled at samplingPeriod. The method is based on an 
%     unconstrained maximization of the continuous estimation of the cross-
%     correlation functions. 'signals' is a M-by-N matrix with one row per 
%     acquired signal. 'microphoned' is a M-by-3 matrix with one row per 
%     microphone's position. TDE is a M(M-1)/2 vector with the TDEs.
