THIS IS A README FILE FOR THE M1QN3 MATLAB-LINUX wrapper.

1. CONTENTS

The files in this folder should be:
  - m1qn3.f: The fortran code of the optimization routine.
  - m1qn3mex.c: The C wrapper for M1QN3 written to be compiled with mex.
  - m1qn3mex.diff: The patch for the wrapper above.
  - compile.sh: A shell script to compile the fortran code and the wrapper.
  - README: this file.

After compilation you'll also get:
  - libm1qn3.so: The shared library correspoding to the fortran routine.
  - m1qn3mex.mexa**: The MEX file callable from MATLAB.

3. CODE DETAILS

M1QN3 is a optimization solver. You can find all the information in [1]. The file in this SVN repository is the original code (you can also download it from [1]).

The original wrapper (written for windows) is part of the OptiToolbox, that can be found in [2].

3. COMPILATION

Just type: $> sh compile.sh

What does the script do?
i.   Compile the fortran code into a shared library.
ii.  Patch the wrapper (commenting native windows calls).
iii. Compile the wrapper linking the fortran library.

4. FORTRAN-C issues.

Depending on the fortran compiler the names of the frotran routines in the shared library will may be different. This is not a problem for fortran, but it is for C. So you may get some errors. That is one of the reasons I had to patch the m1qn3mex.c (the other is windows :) ). If you want more details about how to deal with fortran-c issues I found [3] very instructive.
